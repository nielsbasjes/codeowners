# CodeOwners
In several systems (like GitHub and Gitlab) you can have a CODEOWNERS file which is used to ensure all changes are approved by the right people.

Reality: The syntax of these files can be tricky, and it is quite easy to write a config that has the effect that not all files are covered.

# What is this
1) A Java library to read a CODEOWNERS file.
2) A Java library to read a/all .gitignore file(s) in directory.
3) An extra rule for the Maven Enforcer plugin to check the CODEOWNERS against
   1) the actual project files. (See Usage below)
   2) the actual users, groups and roles in Gitlab. (BETA) (See Usage below)

The intended goal is to make the build fail if the codeowners file does not cover all files and directories in the project.

- The libraries for the CODEOWNERS and gitignore files are usable in Java 8 and newer.
- The Maven Enforcer rule needs Java 11 or newer.

# CodeOwners Enforcer rule
## Configuration parameters

- **baseDir**
  - In case you run the plugin from a child module.
- **codeOwnersFile**
  - The name of the codeowners file when you are not using a common standard.
- **allExisingFilesMustHaveCodeOwner**
  - Check that all existing files have at least one mandatory codeowner.
  - Gitlab also supports "Optional" code owners but that is useless to check for.
- **allNewlyCreatedFilesMustHaveCodeOwner**
  - Check that if a new file is created in any of the directories in the project that it would automatically have a mandatory code owner.
  - Note when a specific filename exception is used in the gitignore rules then this check is not perfect.
- **allFilesMustHaveCodeOwner**
  - Do both allExisingFilesMustHaveCodeOwner and allNewlyCreatedFilesMustHaveCodeOwner
- **verbose**
    - Make the rule output much more details than you would normally like to see.
- **showApprovers**
    - Make the rule output show the approvers for all non-ignored files in the entire project. The intended usage is that with this you can debug the CODEOWNERS result and manually see for every file in your project if you are happy with the resulting approvers.

## Checking against the users present on a Gitlab Instance (BETA)
If you have a Gitlab instance with your project then you can get additional checks done.
This plugin can also verify if all mentioned users, groups and roles are actually allowed to approve a change.
This is important because when Gitlab determines that all the mentioned approvers either do not exist or do not have the appropriate approval level then everyone can merge any change on a file.

___**This is currently a BETA feature.**___

A known limitation is that checking against the email address in a CODEOWNERS file is only possible IF the user has made that specific email address their public address.

### Usage
There are 3 parameters needed to activate this feature:
- The Gitlab Project/Personal Access Token (only `read_api` and `GUEST` role are needed)
- The Gitlab server url
- The Gitlab project id of this project

In practice: When running in Gitlab CI only the access token is needed via an environment variable.

### Gitlab Project/Personal Access Token
To allow this plugin to use the Gitlab API an access token is needed that is created with only `read_api` and the `GUEST` role.

**You should never commit ANY token to a repository so this plugin simply cannot directly read any token.
It is ONLY possible to read it from an environment variable.**

So the token can only be retrieved from an environment variable.
In this example it is expected that the environment variable `CHECK_USERS_TOKEN` contains the value of you token.

```xml
<gitlab>
    <accessToken>
        <environmentVariableName>CHECK_USERS_TOKEN</environmentVariableName>
    </accessToken>
</gitlab>
```

### Gitlab server url
The Gitlab server url can be configured directly or retrieved from an environment variable.
- If not configured it is assumed it can be found in the environment variable `CI_SERVER_URL` which is the default place where Gitlab CI puts it.
- Directly configured:
    ```xml
    <gitlab>
        <serverUrl>
            <url>https://gitlab.example.nl</url>
        </serverUrl>
    </gitlab>
    ```
- Retrieved from a configured environment variable. In this example it is expected that the environment variable `MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` contains something like `https://gitlab.example.nl`.
    ```xml
    <gitlab>
        <serverUrl>
            <environmentVariableName>MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE</environmentVariableName>
        </serverUrl>
    </gitlab>
    ```

### Gitlab project id
The Gitlab project id can be configured directly or retrieved from an environment variable.
- If not configured it is assumed it can be found in the environment variable `CI_PROJECT_ID` which is the default place where Gitlab CI puts it.
- Directly configured:
    ```xml
    <gitlab>
        <projectId>
            <id>group/project</id>
        </projectId>
    </gitlab>
    ```
- Retrieved from a configured environment variable. In this example it is expected that the environment variable `MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` contains something like `group/project`.
    ```xml
    <gitlab>
        <projectId>
            <environmentVariableName>MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE</environmentVariableName>
        </projectId>
    </gitlab>
    ```

                </gitlab>
              </codeOwners>
            </rules>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

# GitIgnore library

## Basic use
Simply create an instance of the GitIgnoreFileSet and pass the root directory of the project as a parameter
```java
GitIgnoreFileSet ignoreFileSet = new GitIgnoreFileSet(new File("/home/niels/workspace/project"));
```
You can then check for each file in the project if it is ignored or not
```java
if (ignoreFileSet.ignoreFile("/home/niels/workspace/project/something/something/README.md")) {
    ...
}
```

## Full path or just or a project relative filename
The directory name with which you initialize the `GitIgnoreFileSet` is considered to be the directory name of the project root.
By default, if you ask for a file if it is ignored or not, this library assumes you are specifying all files within the SAME base directory structure.

So loading the gitignore files from `workspace/project` then a file in the root of the project must (by default) be specified as `workspace/project/pom.xml` and a file deeper in the project as for example `workspace/project/src/main/java/nl/basjes/Something.java`

Something like this:
```java
GitIgnoreFileSet ignoreFileSet = new GitIgnoreFileSet(new File("workspace/project"));

if (ignoreFileSet.ignoreFile("workspace/project/pom.xml")) {
    ...
}
```
So comming from the default situation the `ignoreFileSet.assumeQueriesIncludeProjectBaseDir()` does nothing.


You can **optionally specify** that the files you request are **relative to the project root**.

So loading the gitignore files from `workspace/project` then a file in the root of the project must be specified as `/pom.xml` and a file deeper in the project as for example `/src/main/java/nl/basjes/Something.java`

Something like this:
```java
GitIgnoreFileSet ignoreFileSet = new GitIgnoreFileSet(new File("workspace/project"));

if (ignoreFileSet.ignoreFile("/pom.xml", true)) {
    ...
}
```

Or you can set it as the default assumption.

```java
GitIgnoreFileSet ignoreFileSet = new GitIgnoreFileSet(new File("workspace/project"));
ignoreFileSet.assumeQueriesAreProjectRelative();

if (ignoreFileSet.ignoreFile("/pom.xml")) {
    ...
}
```


## GitIgnore edge case
This [tutorial page](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore) documents this edge case that this library also follows.

I see this as unexpected behaviour yet this is really what git does !

**Pattern**

    logs/
    !logs/important.log

**Matches**

    logs/debug.log
    logs/important.log

**Explanation**

    Wait a minute! Shouldn't logs/important.log be negated in the example on the left
    Nope! Due to a performance-related quirk in Git, you can not negate a file that is ignored due to a pattern matching a directory

# Building
The maven build must be run under Java 17 or newer (because of plugins) and will use toolchains to actually build the software using JDK 21.
