This gitignore file is simply all rules available in the JetBrains ignore plugin for generating a .gitignore file.

Plugin homepage https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7495--ignore
This specific file was generated using this plugin (on 2024-01-10 using version 4.5.2) with the remove duplicates enabled.

Many of these files originate from https://github.com/github/gitignore and https://github.com/toptal/gitignore .

Note that the generated file contains INVALID comment blocks (using /** ... */ and a '#' not on char 1).

These problem cases have been manually fixed and were pushed upstream using https://github.com/github/gitignore/pull/4394 and https://github.com/toptal/gitignore/pull/562
